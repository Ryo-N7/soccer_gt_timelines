# Introduction


Despite recent advances that have overtaken xG

measuring shot quality instead of simply looking at the lump sum of shots taken (off and on target) by one team compared to the other. 

expected goals as a concept is still the most widely-accepted metric by the general public. 



For R users who want to dabble I highly recommend the following:

- 

- 

I started out in soccer analytics mainly to practice my data cleaning and visualization skills and over time it evolved into an entire portfolio of plots and graphs that you can see in []().

At the beginning of last season I figured out how to grab match-level data from [understat.com]() via [Ewen Henderson]()'s [{understatr}]() package and set about creating a "matchday summary graphic". These were intended to visualize the data understat.com provided in my own aesthetically-pleasing way for the general public. 

Version 1 looked like this:

![]()

In the past few months after the Corona extended season ended I intended to make tweaks to the graph above but instead I just started creating other views with the data available while also incorporating some other stuff that I couldn't fit into the original match day viz. 

![look-over-meme]()
"Tweak and improve existing data viz." <> "Create new viz from scratch."

One of the new viz I created was a chronological table of shots during the course of the match which provides the viewer with a lot more details about any single shot. Besides the xG value, things like the "situation" (open play? free kick? etc.), "shot type" (right, left, header), etc. were added for more context. 



2nd season so build MORE for more context 


So here are the new xG summary timelines: 

![LiverpoolLeeds]()



![]()




# Target Audience

# Design Choices


The color-coding of the rows is intended to give you a clear idea of who were dominating shots at any given time period at a glance without even looking too closely at the details. Of course there may be a ton of shots in a small period of time or vice-versa which can skew your perception if you don't look at the "minute" column closely. 



- sparkline timeline: no, cum xg covers that and can't see plot point easily in graph. also the nature of the chronological setup already means you get that aspect of the game anyways
better to focus on something that's easier to see at first glance as highlights the main idea of the table >> shost. 

bold text
emphasize GOALS, OWN GOALS 
add emoji to further highlight (regular version uses a star emoji instead due to HTML-to-PNG conversion issues)

title text: different sizes >> focus on actual score line then down to xG 


Concerns:

large size of file

inexperience with HTML/CSS to get team logos to slot in on either side of the title text.

necessity to be careful about what colors to use as the main team colors (yellow for example is strictly off-limits)


# Data

Data source: understat.com

Definitions for some variables are provided by hovering over column names on the website. Others are opaque but follow same terminology set by other data companies and websites. 

Largest concern is over the accuracy of the xG model that understat uses to produce the xG values for shots. 

Used by regular public and journalists but there's never been any info given to ______ 

Most websites don't due to competitiveness of the analytics space 

but that is the biggest caveat with using the data as I'm not in control over the specific outputs of these calculated statistics. 

For the average Joe this along with the more recent FBref (advanced metrics provided by StatsBomb) are the best free and publically available websites for obtaining this type of data. 

It would be a point of interest to create my own xG model based on the variables provided on understat.com by following some of the "how-to" blog posts around the web.


## Shape of data

Now let's go over what are the data frames you need to create these tables and plots. 

```{r}
shots_df <- readRDS(file = here::here(glue::glue("data/LFC_LUFC_MD1_match_shots_data_clean.RDS")))

roll_sum_df <- readRDS(file = here::here(glue::glue("data/LFC_LUFC_MD1_match_rollsumxG.RDS")))

home_stats <- readRDS(file = here::here(glue::glue("data/LFC_LUFC_MD1_home_stats.RDS")))

away_stats <- readRDS(file = here::here(glue::glue("data/LFC_LUFC_MD1_away_stats.RDS")))

team_stats <- readRDS(file = here::here(glue::glue("data/LFC_LUFC_MD1_team_stats.RDS")))

home_team = "Liverpool"
away_team = "Leeds"
home_color = "#d00027" 
away_color = "#1D428A"
match_date <- "Sep. 12, 2020"
```


1. shots_df = match_shots_data_clean




2. rollsum_df = match_rollsumxG





3. home_stats & away_stats 



# Code Breakdown

## Packages

THe packages we'll be using are some of the usual tidyverse stalwarts such as {dplyr}, {tidyr}, {ggplot2}, {forcats}, etc. For soccer-specific packages we have the {understatr} package for downloading the data (not shown in this blog post) and the {ggsoccer} package for creating soccer fields in {ggplot2}. Last but certainly not least are {grid} and {gridExtra} which are used for advanced plot assembly. We also use the {extrafont} package to make use of some cool fonts for the table/plots, they're loaded in via the `loadfonts()` call. 

```{r}
# Packages
pacman::p_load(dplyr, tidyr, stringr, stringi, purrr,
               tibble, lubridate, glue, rlang, 
               ggplot2, grid, gridExtra, 
               gt, forcats, ggtext, extrafont, ggrepel, 
               understatr, ggsoccer)
## Load fonts
loadfonts(quiet = TRUE)
```


## Creating the soccer field plots

For the actual soccer field I use the {ggsoccer} package. Along with the pitch dimension specifications for data sources like Opta, WyScout, and StatsBomb, the package also allows you to specify your own dimensions to fit your own data. If you want a bit more of an in-depth code through using the {ggsoccer} package, take a look at the package [README](https://github.com/Torvaney/ggsoccer) or have a look at one of my [first blog posts](https://ryo-n7.github.io/2018-06-29-visualize-worldcup/) where I create my own World Cup 2018 data and visualize it with {ggsoccer}. 

After playing around with the dimensions on understat the below are the measurements what I came up with and I defined it as a variable called `pitch_custom`. 

```{r}
pitch_custom <- list(
  length = 587,
  width = 373,
  penalty_box_length = 101,
  penalty_box_width = 211,
  six_yard_box_length = 31,
  six_yard_box_width = 111,
  penalty_spot_distance = 66,
  goal_width = 45,
  origin_x = 0,
  origin_y = 0)
```

Since we are orienting the shot maps vertically we need to convert the coordinates from the horizontal view to vertical. We are only using one side of the pitch we don't need to have different adjustments for the "home" and "away" teams. The new coordinates will be defined to the variables "X" and "Y" capitalized, the lower-case coordinates will be kept in just as a reference and for checking positions. Then we `select()` only the variables we need then capitalize "Goal" and "Own Goal" labels for the table (you could also use `stringr::str_to_upper()` here). 

```{r}
## create coords
match_df <- shots_df %>% 
  ## switch coordinates for vertical view
  mutate(
    x = case_when(
      h_a == "a" ~ X * 587,
      h_a == "h" ~ X * 587,
      TRUE ~ 0),
    y = case_when(
      h_a == "a" ~ Y * 373,
      h_a == "h" ~ Y * 373,
      TRUE ~ 0)) %>%
  mutate(result = case_when(
    result == "Goal" ~ "GOAL",
    result == "Own Goal" ~ "OWN GOAL",
    TRUE ~ result)) %>% 
  mutate(result = forcats::as_factor(result)) %>% 
  mutate(result = forcats::fct_relevel(result, "GOAL", "Saved Shot",
                                       "On Post", "Blocked Shot", 
                                       "Missed Shots", "OWN GOAL")) %>% 
  mutate(id = row_number())
```

This is how the data looks like now. There's a row for every shot in chronological order along with the coordinates for the shots.

```{r}
glimpse(match_df)
```

Using this data frame we can create shot map plots that will serve as the base for a more detailed plot in a later section.

### Function to define base shot map

This function will take the `data` and `team_name` inputs that come from the `match_df` data frame that we just created. This plot will plot **all** shots per team for every row of the data frame. After using `filter()` to only get the shots for the specific team, `annotate_pitch()` is used to create the pitch object using the dimensions we specified in `pitch_custom` earlier. The `theme_pitch()` is a helper function for {ggsoccer} that removes all the background and axes details while `coord_flip()` is used to flip the field so that the goal is at the top of the plot. All the shots will be gray and transparent (via the 'alpha' argument) as later on we will highlight the actual shot for a specific row in our table in a different plotting function. 

```{r}
create_shotmap_basic <- function(df = data, team_name = team_name) {
  
  shotxG_map_raw <- 
    ggplot(df %>% filter(team_name == team_name), 
           aes(x = x, y = y)) +
    annotate_pitch(dimensions = pitch_custom) +
    ## all shots in grey and transparent
    geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y), color = "grey20", 
               size = 3, alpha = 0.3) +
    scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0.01, 0)) +
    theme_pitch(aspect_ratio = 373/587) +
    coord_flip(xlim = c(280, 590), 
               ylim = c(10, 365)) +
    theme(plot.margin = unit(c(0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1), "pt"),
          text = element_markdown(family = "Roboto Condensed"),
          legend.position = "none")    
  
  return(shotxG_map_raw)
}
```


Using the above function now we need to 

We `nest()` the data by "team_name" so that when we plot our basic shot maps each row will plot all the shots for each team in "team_name". By "nesting" the data this way we can apply the plotting function to **all** the data for a specific team team. This way we won't be plotting a basic shot map using shot data from both teams. 

```{r}
match_df %>% tibble::as_tibble() %>% group_by(team_name) %>% nest()
```

The "data" column contains **all** the data that we saw previously for each team. If we `unnest()` the "data" column for the row with "Liverpool" in the "team_name" column we can see that it contains all the data seen previously but **only** for Liverpool. The same will apply if we "unpack" the "data" column for the row with Leeds United. 

```{r}
match_df %>% 
  tibble::as_tibble() %>% 
  group_by(team_name) %>% 
  nest() %>% 
  head(1) %>% 
  unnest(cols = c(data))
```

With this data structure in hand, we apply the basic shot map plot function to every row of data inside the "data" column for both teams. We can do this by passing the "data" and "team_name" columns as the arguments to the shot map function which then iterates over every row in each team's "data" column. 

```{r}
## add blank shot map to all rows
match_df_basic_plot <- match_df %>% 
  tibble::as_tibble() %>% 
  ## nest by team
  group_by(team_name) %>% 
  nest() %>% 
  ## apply plots for all shots per team, for each row in their respective "data" column
  mutate(plot = map2(data, team_name, create_shotmap_basic)) %>% 
  ungroup()
```

When we take a `glimpse()` at our data frame we now see an additional column, "plot" that houses plots for each row of shots for both teams. So Liverpool took 22 total shots and therefore have 22 rows inside "data" which results in 22 plots while for Leeds there are 6, 6, and 6 of the same. Both "data" and "plot" are now what are called "list-columns".

```{r}
glimpse(match_df_basic_plot)
```

So now we have a data frame with a basic shot map for each team for each row of shots. However, all of the detailed info we need for our table is hidden inside the "data" column. We can get those back by `unnest()`-ing the "data" column so all the other shot information is unpacked. 

```{r}
match_df_basic_plot <- match_df_basic_plot %>% 
  unnest(cols = "data") %>% 
  arrange(id)

glimpse(match_df_basic_plot)
```

### Function to define specific shot map

This second plotting function takes the plots we created with the previous base shot map function and adds in the specific shot for each row to the base plot. The "plot" that is being passed into this function are all the plots we had saved in the "plot" column of the data frame. We add in a new `geom_point()` for the specific shot recorded in a row and make it bigger in size and in black to make it stand out from the rest of the shots the team took. At the bottom we add in a label for the xG value.  

```{r}
add_xG_shot <- function(x, y, xG, plot) {
  shotxG_map_point <- 
    plot +
    # specific shot point in black and bold
    geom_point(x = x, y = y, color = "black", 
               size = 12) +
    scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0.01, 0)) +
    ## label for shot point
    geom_label(x = 318, y = 186.5, 
               color = "black", size = 20,
               fill = "white", family = "Roboto Slab",
               label = glue::glue("{xG} xG"))
  
  return(shotxG_map_point)
}
```

## Combining plots to data frame

Before we create the new plots, we finally work with the data frame that has the rolling xG sums. The IDs should match up with the IDs in `match_df_basic_plot` because the `roll_sum_df` data frame is just an expanded version of `match_df_basic_plot` that created empty rows for every minute. Once you `filter()` out those rows without an xG value the rows for both should match up. Be very careful when manipulating both of these data frames in previous steps as it can become very easy for the IDs to get messed up especially when there are multiple chances by either team in the same minute. Make sure the row order of the shots data frame is exactly as downloaded from `understat.com` before applying the IDs to the rows.

```{r}
match_rollsum_simple <- roll_sum_df %>% filter(xG != 0.00) %>% mutate(id = row_number()) %>% select(id, rollsum_goal)
```

Since we have more than two arguments that we are passing to the `add_xG_shot()` function we need to iterate over every row using the `pmap()` function instead of `map2()`.

```{r}
## map plot to df again with a shot point for each row/plot
dfdfdf <- match_df_basic_plot %>% 
  ## shot-per-row, using 'plot' as base pass along the 'x', 'y' coordinates and xG value
  ## to "add_xG_shot()` function for each row. 
  ## have empty 'ggplot' column for gt plot-insertion purposes
  mutate(complete_plot = pmap(list(x, y, xG, plot), add_xG_shot),
         ggplot = NA) %>% 
  select(-plot) %>% 
  left_join(match_rollsum_simple, by = "id")
```

We can check the data frame for the plot in the first row, which is the first shot in the game from Mo Salah in the 7th minute.

```{r}
dfdfdf$complete_plot[[1]]
```

Now for a plot for a row where the team is Leeds United. You can see that the plot is different from the Liverpool one as the "grey"-ed out shots are Leeds' other shots. This is because of what we did earlier in creating the "basic" shot map for each team separately.

```{r}
dfdfdf$complete_plot[[4]]
```

shot points could be color of team. rather keep consistently black as some colors might not work so well as solid points >>> use black as the stroke outline?

## Tidying up to prep for table creation

We are now very close to the data frame we need to start making the table.

```{r}
glimpse(dfdfdf)
```

There are a lot of columns that we won't really need for the table so we'll do some final cleaning up before we get to the {gt} table code. We `select()` for the columns that hold the info that we really need and then make edits to `lastAction` column to clean them up a bit. We replace any `NA`s with a blank so they don't show up in the table as `NA` text. A new `player_name` column is created by concatenating the `firstname` and `player` (which contains the player's last name) columns into one. Finally we use the new `relocate()` function to place the newly created `player_name` column to be placed after the `team_name` column. 

```{r}
## data creation for actual table
match_shots_table_df <- dfdfdf %>% 
  select(minute, team_name, result, xG, firstname, player, 
         ggplot, complete_plot, rollsum = rollsum_goal,
         situation, type = shotType, player_assisted, lastAction) %>% 
  ## player name labels, clean "lastAction"
  mutate(player_name = paste(firstname, player),
         lastAction = if_else(lastAction == "None", NA_character_, lastAction)) %>% 
  ## NAs as blanks
  mutate(across(where(is.character), ~ replace_na(., ""))) %>% 
  ## take out extraneous name vars and move to after team name
  select(-firstname, -player) %>% 
  relocate(player_name, .after = team_name) 

glimpse(match_shots_table_df)
```

## The table

To give rows where the shots are goals a bit of 'oomph' in the table, we will add a soccer ball emoji next to the all-caps "GOAL" text. We can add in the unicode version of the emoji as an object that we'll then `paste()` into the text. From my attempts it only works well for the `.HTML` output and for the `.PNG` output I use for my regular match summary graphics I have to use a "star" emoji instead as the soccer ball one doesn't render too well in `.PNG`.

```{r}
soccer_ball <- "<span style='color:white;font-size:25px'>&#9917;</span>"
```





```{r}
gt(match_shots_table_df) %>% 
  tab_header(   
    title = gt::html(glue::glue("<p><img src='Liverpool_FC.png' alt='LFC' style='width:190px;vertical-align:middle;margin:50px 50px 50px 150px;'><span style='font-size:35px'>({home_stats$xG} xG)</span> <b style='color:{home_color}; font-size:55px'>{home_team}</b> <span style='font-size:70px'>{home_stats$GOALS} - </span><span style='font-size:70px'>{away_stats$GOALS}</span> <b style='color:{away_color}; font-size:55px'>{away_team}</b> <span style='font-size:35px'>({away_stats$xG} xG)</span><img src='Leeds_United_FC.png' alt='LUFC' style='width:190px;vertical-align:middle;margin:50px 150px 50px 50px;'></p> <p><span style='font-size:40px'>Premier League 2020-2021: Matchday 1 ({match_date})</span></p>")
    )
  )
```
